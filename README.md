# Isobar Puzzle - Tony Polinelli

### Notes:

* Didnt use a boilerplate
* Typescript
* Used Mobx Stores data style, as the application is quite basic
* Directly linked to model (vs events) to simplicity

Additions

* multiple themes
* animation (using library)
* preview

I could try to optimize the size of the build by extracting the images, this would make the bundle smaller - but for the example, its not really needed.

### Commands:

```
yarn
yarn dev
yarn build
yarn stats # to view stats output
```
